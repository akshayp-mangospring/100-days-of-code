In this 100 days, I'll build at least 20 apps in Rails which includes small and larger ones, so as to become really proficient in Back End. It'll also include some of the new things which I will try to learn such as writing larger apps in React's latest version, since I've lost touch with it.

Day 1 - 26 September 2022:
Traversy Media's crash course on Rails begins. It's of 2 hrs only, so I'll try to wrap that up as fast as possible.
Rails works on MVC - Model layer talks with DB, Controllers handle requests and Views handle the display of page to the user.

Today's App:
The App is a Food Log App which takes in entries for the food which a person has in one day. The food entries are grouped according to a day, the latest day is shown first, then the previous days, in descending order. In a day the first 3 entries are shown with a "View all entries for the day" button which takes us to a new page whcih has entries for the entire day. We can also see the total intake of food in a day by clicking on "View all entries for the day".

Day 2 - 27 September 2022:
Actual:
Yesterday's `food_log` app isn't even complete. I'll complete it later by myself. I didn't work on anything on this today. Such a sham!

Day 3 - 28 September 2022:
Motto:
I'll start off with DHH's starter video from Rails website.
I'll also start off with reading the Docs for rails from Rails Guides. In it, I'm going to read Active Record Active Model in detail.

Actual:
Today, I just started with DHH's video for Rails and added notes for Rails which I can use for future references. I've just completed 4 mins out of 34 mins in DHH's video. My most of the time was spent in making notes. However, I'll make sure that I spend more time on actual programming in the upcoming days.

Day 4 - 29 September 2022:
Motto:
Finish off DHH's video and start off on Food Log app again.
Start making faster progress in Rails, since I think I'm going very slow.
Start reading Active Record basics. I think I need to get my hand on DB deisgn as well quickly.

Actual:
Today, I added a few gotchas in Rails notes. Now resuming on DHH's video. I've completed watching of DHH's video, but I've not implemented it completely, even though I sat for extra time today.

Day 5 - 30 September 2022:
Motto:
Finish off implementation of DHH's video. Revise stuff quickly, so that I can pick up pace in the upcoming apps.
Start off on

Actual:
I did nothing on this day. Such a shame.

For 4-5 days, I did nothing in this particular Repo, but I was working on the Back End work that the company had assigned me. And even more work is getting assigned to me in the Back End. So, I'm happy to be doing it.

Day 6 - 4 October 2022:
Motto:
Start off again on the Food Log App. Try to finish it today.

Actual:
I started on the Food Log App, made miniscule progress but was wrapped up in company work.

Day 7 - 5 October 2022:
Motto:
Finish the Food Log App today.

Actual:
I've added a Food Log API only App and I'm integrating it with React.
I've solved the CORS issues on the Front and the Back, added SimpleCSS, added a Popup with an overlay.
Integrated Create, Read Actions in the Food Log API App.
Added the validations for the data.

Day 8 - 6 October 2022:
Motto:
Finish the Full Stack App of basic CRUD for Food Log API.

Actual:
I've finished the Full Stack App of basic CRUD for Food Log API.

Day 9 - 7 October 2022:
Motto:
Try to expand the application with more models, functionality.

Actual:
I felt totally disastrous today, I felt worthless for not being able to learn and implement stuff quickly.
I basically did nothing today and procrastinated all day long.

Day 10 - 8 October 2022:
Motto:
Try to add more functionality to the App
Add Todo List with desc, to do items
Add Todo Items to Todo List
Add User Model
Make meals belong to a user

Actual:
I stayed overnight at Hitesh's flat
Added him as a collaborator and and made all the commits from his computer in his name
Added all the basic stuff of new features I wanted to add today
Restructured Code for the App

To Dos for the App:
Add React Routing for on the client. Show only login, signup links a hero view and a basic homepage before Authenticating.
Add Authentication flow using `JWT` for the App and write down the findings in the `Notes.txt` of the App
Add an authentication middleware after adding JWT to the mix. So that only authenticated users are able to perform certain actions.
After getting inside the app, just let the user create to do lists for himself, along with adding To do items inside a to do list.

==== UNINTENDED LONG BREAK IN 100 DAYS OF CODE ====
===================================================

1 December 2022:
It's been a very long time that I didn't resume working on my 100 days of code, since I was struggling with consistency.
But now, I'm more strategic and more consistent than I was ever before. I am exercising consistently, sleeping early at about 10pm and waking up at 4am, which is revolutionary & I am really proud of it. It feels like that I can solve complex problems and can achieve big goals if I am consistent.
Even when I now look into the mirror I am more confident about my capabilities since exercising is changing my body for the better by the day. My strength is increasing and I am more energetic because if it.
I also have developed a routine which I follow religiously and I have also started to note down everything that I need to do and need to focus on. It's surprising that such simple habits like noting down the stuff you need to do and having a log of what you have done in the day by the hour can have such profound effects over your mentality. It's a major confidence booster since it gives us absolute control over things and ultimately over our day.
I am now more willing to try out and do new things, which I was reluctant in doing before. Examples of which are: me joining a German class, me starting exercising, me taking part in organising and playing a role in events in our company, me buying gym clothes, buying veggies and food items for the house, me doing things by initiative instead of dictation like buying a watch, a ring for AauSaheb, etc.
I am also putting up honest efforts in whatever I do. Examples of which are: I am not picky about the stuff that is handed to me to work upon, I am exercising so that it can produce real results, I am honestly trying to help people, I am helping in household chores, even taking care of Jumbo as and when the time demands, etc.
I am also becoming more responsible, committed & accountable to people. Examples of which are: I maintain a note of the people I need to get back to when someone has asked me for help, or if I need to report to someone about the status of something which was supposed to be done by me, talking with Saheb & AauSaheb on family matters, taking a little care of them, taking care of Jumbo, etc.
Also a thing I learnt was that not to discard my small achievements, instead I should celebrate all of my small achievements since it compounds and helps us to grow exponentially. The Compound Effect works.
MY LIFE IS LITERALLY CHANGING FOR THE BETTER.
Now I'm off to exercising, since it's time to exercise, maybe I'll get back to 100 days of code later in the day.
Btw, I'm gonna restart my 100 days of code from day 1 again.
