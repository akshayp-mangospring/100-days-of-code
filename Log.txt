In this 100 days, I'll build at least 20 apps in Rails which includes small and larger ones, so as to become really proficient in Back End. It'll also include some of the new things which I will try to learn such as writing larger apps in React's latest version, since I've lost touch with it.

Day 1 - 26 September 2022:
Traversy Media's crash course on Rails begins. It's of 2 hrs only, so I'll try to wrap that up as fast as possible.
Rails works on MVC - Model layer talks with DB, Controllers handle requests and Views handle the display of page to the user.

Today's App:
The App is a Food Log App which takes in entries for the food which a person has in one day. The food entries are grouped according to a day, the latest day is shown first, then the previous days, in descending order. In a day the first 3 entries are shown with a "View all entries for the day" button which takes us to a new page whcih has entries for the entire day. We can also see the total intake of food in a day by clicking on "View all entries for the day".

Day 2 - 27 September 2022:
Actual:
Yesterday's `food_log` app isn't even complete. I'll complete it later by myself. I didn't work on anything on this today. Such a sham!

Day 3 - 28 September 2022:
Motto:
I'll start off with DHH's starter video from Rails website.
I'll also start off with reading the Docs for rails from Rails Guides. In it, I'm going to read Active Record Active Model in detail.

Actual:
Today, I just started with DHH's video for Rails and added notes for Rails which I can use for future references. I've just completed 4 mins out of 34 mins in DHH's video. My most of the time was spent in making notes. However, I'll make sure that I spend more time on actual programming in the upcoming days.

Day 4 - 29 September 2022:
Motto:
Finish off DHH's video and start off on Food Log app again.
Start making faster progress in Rails, since I think I'm going very slow.
Start reading Active Record basics. I think I need to get my hand on DB deisgn as well quickly.

Actual:
Today, I added a few gotchas in Rails notes. Now resuming on DHH's video. I've completed watching of DHH's video, but I've not implemented it completely, even though I sat for extra time today.

Day 5 - 30 September 2022:
Motto:
Finish off implementation of DHH's video. Revise stuff quickly, so that I can pick up pace in the upcoming apps.
Start off on

Actual:
I did nothing on this day. Such a shame.

For 4-5 days, I did nothing in this particular Repo, but I was working on the Back End work that the company had assigned me. And even more work is getting assigned to me in the Back End. So, I'm happy to be doing it.

Day 6 - 4 October 2022:
Motto:
Start off again on the Food Log App. Try to finish it today.

Actual:
I started on the Food Log App, made miniscule progress but was wrapped up in company work.

Day 7 - 5 October 2022:
Motto:
Finish the Food Log App today.

Actual:
I've added a Food Log API only App and I'm integrating it with React.
I've solved the CORS issues on the Front and the Back, added SimpleCSS, added a Popup with an overlay.
Integrated Create, Read Actions in the Food Log API App.
Added the validations for the data.

Day 8 - 6 October 2022:
Motto:
Finish the Full Stack App of basic CRUD for Food Log API.

Actual:
I've finished the Full Stack App of basic CRUD for Food Log API.

Day 9 - 7 October 2022:
Motto:
Try to expand the application with more models, functionality.

Actual:
I felt totally disastrous today, I felt worthless for not being able to learn and implement stuff quickly.
I basically did nothing today and procrastinated all day long.

Day 10 - 8 October 2022:
Motto:
Try to add more functionality to the App
Add Todo List with desc, to do items
Add Todo Items to Todo List
Add User Model
Make meals belong to a user

Actual:
I stayed overnight at Hitesh's flat
Added him as a collaborator and and made all the commits from his computer in his name
Added all the basic stuff of new features I wanted to add today
Restructured Code for the App

To Dos for the App:
Add React Routing for on the client. Show only login, signup links a hero view and a basic homepage before Authenticating.
Add Authentication flow using `JWT` for the App and write down the findings in the `Notes.txt` of the App
Add an authentication middleware after adding JWT to the mix. So that only authenticated users are able to perform certain actions.
After getting inside the app, just let the user create to do lists for himself, along with adding To do items inside a to do list.
